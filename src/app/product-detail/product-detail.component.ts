    "overviewInfo": "The most common type of springs that comes to mind when thinking of springs. Compression springs as the name suggest will compress when loaded and are used in a variety of applications.There are many kinds of compression spring such as straight body compression spring, conical spring, variable diameter. Compression spring also can be  closed ended , open ended, pig tailed and open reduced on centre . The ends can also be grounded to exact specifications also We at Asha springs have spent almost half a decade studying and manufacturing such springs. Compression springs can be made by cold winding and hot winding depending on the wire diameter of the spring required. We have an  inhouse capacity to manufacture compression spring with wire diameter of 0.10mm-25.00mm.",

    "materialInfo":"Spring steel is considered a general use steel because of its ability to be durable, yet flexible with a high degree of strength. It has the unique ability to be formed, shaped, and post heat treated, which makes it one of the premium choices for manufacturing springs for automotive, auto electrical and electrical applications.Stainless steel is good for corrosion resistant and Inconel is best for springs being used at very high temperatures.When it comes to springs that are required to be non-magnetic, Stainless Steel 316 can be used. This material type isnâ€™t 100% non-magnetic though. Stainless steel 316 is only 90% non-magnetic.",

    "overviewInfo": "Tension Springs/Extension Springs are helical wound coils, wrapped tightly together to create tension. Extension springs are springs which absorb and store energy by offering resistance to a pulling force. Extension springs usually have hooks, loops, or end coils that are pulled out and formed from each end of the body. The function of an extension spring is to provide extended force when the spring is pulled apart from its original length.",

Garter springs are basically extension springs or compression springs whose ends are connected to make a garter belt that will exert force from its inner diameter. Compression garter springs exert outward radial forces, while extension garter springs exert inward radial forces. Their design is crucial to guarantee maximum functionality, so itâ€™s important that factors like where & how the spring will be used are taken into consideration. They are usually produced with Carbon steel or Stainless steel wire. Since they are able to withstand forces from all directions, they are effective at handling changes in volume, pressure, temperature & viscosity.",
